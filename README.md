Dispatcher Co-Pilot (MV3 ‚Ä¢ TypeScript ‚Ä¢ Preact + Vite)

A ToS-compliant, user-initiated Chrome/Edge extension that adds a slide-out Dispatcher Actions drawer on DAT pages to speed up dispatcher workflows‚Äîwithout automated scraping/exporting.

‚öñÔ∏è Compliance first: The extension only acts on the currently visible, user-clicked posting. No pagination, no background crawling, no headless automation, no credential storage.

Features (all require an explicit user action)

Parse visible fields from the clicked row/card (equipment, lane, miles, weight, rate, pickup/delivery times, broker).

Compute RPM & deadhead using user settings.

Open mailto: (with a template) and tel: (broker call). No auto-sending.

Copy normalized text/JSON to clipboard.

Send one record to your TMS webhook (HTTPS) on click; show a toast.

Minimal drawer UI (Shadow DOM), keyboard-friendly, AA contrast, non-disruptive overlay.

Tech Stack

Manifest V3 (Chrome/Edge)

TypeScript + Vite (fast build)

Preact (tiny) for the drawer/Options UI, rendered inside Shadow DOM

Web Crypto (AES-GCM) for encrypting the TMS token in storage

zod (optional) for runtime validation

Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e against HTML fixtures)

ESLint + Prettier for code quality

Getting Started
1) Install
npm i

2) Build (or dev)
npm run build     # produce dist/
# or
npm run dev       # vite dev server (for Options page); still load dist/ in Chrome

3) Load in Chrome/Edge

Open chrome://extensions (or edge://extensions)

Enable Developer mode

Click Load unpacked ‚Üí select the dist/ folder

In the extension‚Äôs Site access, grant your DAT host(s) (e.g., https://power.dat.com/*)

Usage

Navigate to a DAT results or posting page (on an allowed host).

Click the row action (üìû or ‚úâÔ∏è) injected by the extension, or press the shortcut to open the drawer.

From the drawer: Compute, Copy, Email, Call, or Send to TMS (single record).

Keyboard shortcuts

Ctrl/‚åò + Shift + L ‚Äì open/close the drawer

Inside drawer: E Email, T Call, C Copy, S Send to TMS (buttons still require confirm click if you implement that pattern)

Options / Settings

Identity

Login email (for signature/template context)

Email used for sending (mailto prefill only)

Company: Name, MC, phone

Templates

Email subject/body with mustache-style vars:

{{origin_city}}, {{origin_state}}, {{destination_city}}, {{destination_state}}, {{total_mileage}}, {{rate}}, {{date}}, {{company}}, {{mc}}, {{phone}}

Operations

RPM target(s), deadhead radius (mi), truck/home location (optional)

Integrations

TMS webhook URL (HTTPS) + token (encrypted at rest via AES-GCM)

Security

Allowed hostnames (domain allowlist)

Telemetry (off by default)

Note: The extension never stores or uses DAT credentials. Settings are local to the browser profile.

Security & Privacy

Principle of least privilege (MV3 permissions): storage, clipboardWrite, activeTab, scripting, (optional) notifications.

No background scraping; content script only reads visible DOM after a user click.

Token protection: TMS token is encrypted with Web Crypto (AES-GCM) and a per-session key.

PII minimization: No data is transmitted unless the user clicks Send to TMS; telemetry is opt-in and PII-free.

CSP: Options page uses MV3 defaults; no remote scripts/styles; no eval.

Compliance Guardrails (Hard Rules)

‚ùå Do not automate searches, paginate, or export multiple postings.

‚ùå Do not make hidden requests to fetch DAT data.

‚ùå Do not store DAT credentials or weaken site security.

‚úÖ Only act on the clicked posting‚Äôs visible fields.

‚úÖ Every action requires an explicit user gesture (click/shortcut + confirm).

Scripts
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint        # eslint
npm test            # vitest unit tests
npm run e2e         # playwright (if you add fixtures)
npm run build       # build to dist/
npm run dev         # vite dev (Options page)

Testing

Unit (Vitest): DOM parsers (with HTML stubs), template engine, RPM math (edge cases).

E2E (Playwright, optional):

Domain gating (works only on allowed hosts)

Drawer opens from user gesture

Single-record TMS webhook succeeds/fails with clear toasts

Clipboard copy content checks

No background network when idle

Release / Packaging

Build: npm run build ‚Üí dist/

Zip dist/ for store upload or enterprise distribution

Keep a CHANGELOG and a one-click rollback plan (disable or revert to previous version)

Troubleshooting

Drawer doesn‚Äôt open: Ensure the host is in Site access and the page is a supported DAT view.

Buttons disabled: Add TMS URL/token in Options; confirm HTTPS.

No phone/email on posting: Those actions stay disabled‚Äîextension won‚Äôt infer or fetch hidden data.

Clipboard blocked: Ensure you clicked the action (user gesture is required by browsers).

Contributing
